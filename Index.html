        <p>Hello there reader.
            My name is Shourya Narayana and I like coding as well as playing games like roblox, geometry dash and others alike.<br>
            I generally don't do too much coding and rather only code when I have classes for it or when I just feel bored.<br>
            I don't know that much about coding and I'm actually writing this because I'm currently learning about website building.<br>
            I have quite a few friends that I like playing with and I generally enjoy being with them and playing with them.<br>
            I hope this is not too long when I debug test, which in hindsight, it probably is gonna be very long but I might as well keep writing.<br>
            Anyways, I hope you have a fun time trying to navigate this website, if it will have any links that is.<br>
        </p><br>
        <p> I am also an avid gamer and I like playing quite a few games such as Roblox, Minecraft and some steam games that I have bought over the years<br>
            I like playing games on Roblox such as Dummies vs Noobs, Pressure, DCO's and much more.<br>
            I also have grudges against some games like Dummies vs noobs the game I just mentioned and the reason why is because of two things.<br>
            One: Cloaker spam.<br><br>
            Two: The games difficulty scaling and just general difficulty.<br>
            The first point that being cloaker spam, just means that one enemy from the game aka the cloaker is spawned way too much during the rounds.<br>
            The second point being the difficulty scaling just means the way the game sends enemies to you.<br><br>
            There's way too many enemies on the later waves making them extremly difficult and also kind of rage inducing.<br>
            Some of these waves being wave 4, 5 and 6 as they are the most annoying waves at least for me.<br>
            The reason why is beacuse I might be focusing on some other really annyoing enemy like the APU and then bam I get crubstomped to the ground by a cloaker.<br>
            It's just really annoying dieing to an enemy that takes five bullets kill.<br>
            Anyways, that's all I have to say for the game right now, I still have to actually solo it on my own and then I could give some more information on the game and its enemies but apart from that theres nothing much. Bye i guess.<br>
